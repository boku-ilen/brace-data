Barriers Reviewed And Curated for Evaluation

In an upcoming publication, we present a method to automatically assess barrier data from other broadly available open data. In order to validate this data, we manually mapped three 1.5 x 1.5 km areas; this served as "ground truth" data to compare our automated results against. We make them available here to aid future research on the same topic.
﻿
Contains three regions representative of rural Austrian areas:
﻿
- Elsbach: a typical Eastern Austrian town with flat relief, dominated by single-family homes.
- Bad Hofgastein: a village in an Alpine valley with scattered settlements.
- Schlaming: a rural region on an Alpine hillside dominated by pastures and farmhouses.
